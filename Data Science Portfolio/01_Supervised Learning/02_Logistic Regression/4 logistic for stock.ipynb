    "1. **Data Download**: We download stock data for Apple (AAPL) using `yfinance` from 2020 to 2023.\n",
    "2. **Feature Engineering**:\n",
    "   - **Daily Return**: The percentage change between consecutive closing prices (calculated using `pct_change()`).\n",
    "   - **Lagged Closing Price**: The previous day's closing price as a predictor for the current day's movement.\n",
    "3. **Target Variable**: A binary target indicating whether the next day's closing price is higher (`1`) or lower (`0`) than today's close.\n",
    "4. **Model Training**: We use logistic regression to predict the target variable based on the daily return and the lagged closing price.\n",
    "5. **Evaluation**: The model's accuracy and performance are evaluated using the accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You Can Customize:\n",
    "- **Features**: You can include other price-based features like price differences, rolling mean changes, or even n-day returns.\n",
    "- **Target**: You can experiment with different ways to define the target, such as predicting specific percentage changes or incorporating stop-loss targets.\n",

    "This model uses only historical price data to predict price movement direction, making it a very basic starting point for stock prediction. \n",
    "It can be further enhanced with additional features or advanced models for better accuracy."
