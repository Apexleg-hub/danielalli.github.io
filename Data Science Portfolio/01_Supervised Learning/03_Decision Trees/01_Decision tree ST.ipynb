    "Performing a decision tree prediction on total sales using price and units sold is a common task in predictive analytics. Here's a general outline of the steps you would take:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Collection**: Gather historical data on total sales, price, and units sold. Ensure that you have a sufficient amount of data to train your model effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Preprocessing**: This step involves cleaning the data and preparing it for analysis. You may need to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure that the data is in the right format for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Feature Engineering**: You might consider creating additional features from the existing ones if necessary. For example, you could calculate the total revenue (price * units sold) as a new feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Split Data**: Split your data into training and testing sets. The training set will be used to train the decision tree model, and the testing set will be used to evaluate its performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Model Training**: Train a decision tree model using the training data. The model will learn the relationship between the features (price and units sold) and the target variable (total sales).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the trained model using the testing data. Common metrics for regression tasks like this include Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Tune the hyperparameters of the decision tree model to improve its performance. Hyperparameters control the behavior of the model, such as the maximum depth of the tree or the minimum number of samples required to split a node.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Prediction**: Once you are satisfied with the performance of the model, you can use it to make predictions on new data. Given the price and units sold for a new product, the model will predict the total sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Deployment**: Deploy the trained model into your production environment so that it can be used to make real-time predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a high-level overview of the process. Each step may involve further sub-steps and considerations depending on the specifics of your data and the requirements of your problem."
